## Immediate Next Steps (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### 1. Advanced Nginx Configuration Management

**Priority**: High - Core nginx management functionality
**Implementation Plan**:
```typescript
// Configuration management structure
interface NginxConfig {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'server' | 'upstream' | 'location';
  content: string;
  validation: {
    isValid: boolean;
    errors: string[];
  };
  backup: {
    enabled: boolean;
    versions: ConfigVersion[];
  };
}

// Backend endpoints to implement:
// GET    /api/v1/nginx/configs          - List all configurations
// GET    /api/v1/nginx/configs/{id}     - Get specific configuration
// POST   /api/v1/nginx/configs          - Create new configuration
// PUT    /api/v1/nginx/configs/{id}     - Update configuration
// DELETE /api/v1/nginx/configs/{id}     - Delete configuration
// POST   /api/v1/nginx/configs/{id}/validate - Validate configuration
// POST   /api/v1/nginx/configs/{id}/deploy   - Deploy configuration
// POST   /api/v1/nginx/configs/{id}/backup   - Create backup
// POST   /api/v1/nginx/configs/{id}/restore  - Restore from backup
```

### 2. Historical Data and Analytics

**Implementation Plan**:
```go
// Backend metrics storage
type HistoricalMetric struct {
    ID        uint      `gorm:"primaryKey"`
    Timestamp time.Time `gorm:"index"`
    MetricType string   `gorm:"index"`
    Value     float64
    Metadata  JSON      `gorm:"type:jsonb"`
}

// Analytics endpoints:
// GET /api/v1/analytics/metrics/{type}?timerange=...
// GET /api/v1/analytics/trends/{metric}
// GET /api/v1/analytics/alerts
```

### 3. Testing and Quality Assurance

**Test Implementation Priority**:
1. Unit tests for service layer functions
2. Integration tests for API endpoints
3. Frontend component testing with React Testing Library
4. End-to-end testing with Cypress or Playwright

**Recommendation**: Start with PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for simplicity and consistency

### 3. Security Enhancement Priorities

**Phase 4 Security Roadmap**:
1. Multi-factor authentication implementation
2. Advanced access control with time-based restrictions
3. Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
